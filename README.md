## Summary 
The results of the analysis shows that most users ride the bikes for their daily commute regardless of their gender. The vast majority of these users are also subscribers which is a good indicator that this is a valuable program for them. There are also users who are not subscribed that usually ride the bikes on weekends so the bikes are utilized throughtout the week. Therefore, a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. Two additional visualizations that can be used for future analysis is the number of trips taken by age and the number of trips taken by age and gender.
